Project Denver is actually phibiaNES Next.

The reason for this NES emulator is accuracy. I want to build the most accurate NES emulator. Everything component of the NES
will be implemented in software. Including the BUS, The connections to the cart. (In-cart emulation of mapper-chips).
True BUS put/get emulation. Per Cycle CPU emulation. Per Cycle PPU emulation. NMI delays, IRQ delays. Everything documented about
the NES will be emulated. Don't expect this to run on low-end machines.

It will be developed using a Intel I7-4790K @ 4.0Ghz w/ 16GB RAM
